> Example of VueJS project with multiple files. 

*Please note that I committed the `dist` folder which is not a normal thing to do.  I did it simply to allow github pages to serve up the example web page.*

## To recreate this project:

``` bash
# install vue-cli
npm i -g vue-cli

# generate out the webpack template
vue init webpack my-project-name
```


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
